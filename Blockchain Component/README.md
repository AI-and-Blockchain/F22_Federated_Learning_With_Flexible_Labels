## Blockchain component

### Main Idea
    - The Blockchain component is mainly focus on the smart contacts sector.Key idea is establishing the transaction between user and trainer. [After you pay, a certain amount of data from a model will be given to you to use the model.] 
    - Reward system -> If the trainer trained a "perfect" model, we will reward the trainer some "tokens" (testnet tokens)


### Accomplishments so far:
    - Define the general workflow and the main idea in the blockchain component. 
    - Research and planning to use [BigchainDB](https://www.bigchaindb.com/) to store all the data for this project. 
    - Still playing around with the [BigchainDB](https://www.bigchaindb.com/) to see how's the outcome for this project.

### Next step:
    - Smart Contract transaction implementation 
    - Fake data testing in BigchainDB
