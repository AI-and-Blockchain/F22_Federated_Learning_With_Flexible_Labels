# AI & Blockchain Final Project

A Decentralized AI Architecture for Training an Ensemble Model With Flexible Labels

Project Overview:
We want to build a decentralized AI architecture that could train an ensemble model using datasets with a flexible number of labels. Also, we want to use blockchain to incentivize data owners to train models and allow clients to use the ensemble model for prediction.

We plan to use the CIFAR-10 dataset for simulation and testing. Then, we evaluate the feasibility and performance of using an ensemble model for training and prediction.




## TODO
1. AI Component:
    * Create a custom loss function to minimize false positives
    * Document simulation and testing details

2. Federated Learning:
    * Implement asynchronous model parameters (at least, list of numbers and strings) sharing
    * 

3. Blockchain Component:
    * Create smart contracts to ensure data sharing
